## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control helps in tracking and managing changes done in the software.it enables different people to work simultaneously on the same software.
Github is popular because it helps developers work effectively due to its built-in user base tools.


## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

once you create a branch, create a pull request, find your pull request for your branch merger and select it then submit.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
A pull requet is used to propose and collaborate changes to a repository, it helps in reviewing and discussing the changes before they are made to the main code base.
On your repository go to the branch menu, chose the branch that contains your commits, click compare and pull requestselect the branch you want to merge your changes into, chose the branch you made your changes in and type a title for your pull request, click on create pull request.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
forking is making a copy of a repository that allows you to make new changes without impacting the original project by sharing codes and visibility settings. useful in open source projects.
cloning is downloading the entire repository to your local computer.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
they helps to record and follow up on issues and bugs during the development of a software, helps in priotizing tasks and manage workflow and also helps in assigning responsibilities during the process.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
challenges of using github
1. bug risks and error generation
2. limited privacy in free plans
3. tedious long pull requests and merge issues
4. cost of private repository

   best practices
   1.you can secure your account with a two factor authenticator and other github security features
   2. use clear repositpry naming
   3. classify repository wih topics
   4. maintain a clean commit history
   5. leverage issue tracking and projects
